# Predicting Media Partisanship in Relation to the 2020 U.S. Presidential Election
Facebook is becoming an increasingly popular distributor of political news, especially among younger generations. As the 2020 U.S. presidential election approaches, news outlets are reporting on a variety of political topics, and their readers are interacting with them on a widespread scale. This project uses these ideas to conduct an investigation into the most frequently discussed political topics across partisan and nonpartisan news sources on Facebook and builds a classification system to predict partisanship of news posts. To accomplish this, the code for the project uses Selenium with Chromedriver and BeautifulSoup to scrape, store, and parse publicly accessible posts on Facebook, and the NLTK package for Python to create a supervised classification system.
